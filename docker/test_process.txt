Test process
------------

In the docker container, an nginx server was used to host the single page static site
Docker was set to run on localhost, with port 8080 displaying the index.html file using the command "docker run -it -d -p 8080:80 sca-assesment".
To test that the container was running perfectly, both a terminal test and browser test was done.
	For terminal:
		test: "curl localhost:8080"
		
		output: contents of the index.html page was displayed in terminal
		
	For browser:
		test: visit "http://localhost:8080"
		
		output: page was displayed correctly in browser
